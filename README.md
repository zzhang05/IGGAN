# Evaluation Codes and Pre-trained models of WACV2024 paper ''Improving the Fairness of the Min-Max Game in GANs Training''

We have provided the pre-trained IGGAN models on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets for better obtaining the results we reported in the paper. The code of this module is build on our selves based on the test model the DiffAug-GAN [[link]](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans) and NDA-GAN.
